# A Star Algorithm 
This is a simple demo using java awt. It is a simulation of a maze, there is a start and a goal. In every step the program will evaluate the neighbors node using A*, until it found a path (if possible)
There are many things to improve
- There are some "parallel" methods, but they are not optimal, even worse than the secuencial ones 

Events:
- *Space*: Step
- *Enter*: Find the path
- *R*: Reset path found
- *C*: Clear maze
- *G*: Generate obstacles (If there is no solution for the maze, generate again xd)
